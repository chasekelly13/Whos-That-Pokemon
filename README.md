# Whos-That-Pokemon

"Who's That Pokemon?" Game

Were you a kid in the 90's? If you were you probably watched the iconic anime 'Pokemon'. It was a world wide hit that came over to the states in the late 90's. I remember loving this show to death when I was younger, playing the gameboy games, and even collecting the cards (Which I wish I would have held on to more since they could be paying my bills now). If you ever watch the show when you were younger than you will know the memorable game that padded the commercial breaks with the iconic theme "Who's that Pokemon". Well my love for the show and the franchise in general along with my newfound passion for coding drove me to recreate this wonderful game and bring it to you on your desktop (and hopefully mobile device) in the 21st century. Users can boot up this game and are given a silhoutte of a Pokemon then are prompted to guess what it's name is. Since it has been several years since the first generation of Pokemon have appreaded I have also provided helpful hints that may reduce your score, but can give you the extra push your brain might need to remember some of your old friends. Check out my game at "(toBeDeterminedWebsite XD)".

Included Features:

1. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application.
2. Choose generations: Choose which generations of Pokemon you want to play the game with.
3. Score for your guesses: Either have hints associated with each Pokemon or having a score associated with how many guesses you use
4. Have a Two Player Option: Have an option to play against friends and play against them.
5. Spelling Helper: Create a funciton to give people that have Pokemon names that are close correct the correct spelling
